# Watcher continuity

The watcher remains intentionally one-shot: one actionable reason closes one watcher cycle.
Must-work continuity now lives above that process boundary instead of depending on the model remembering a re-arm step.

## Ownership

Pi's `.pi/extensions/fm-primary-pi-watch.ts` and OpenCode's `.opencode/plugins/fm-primary-watch-arm.js` own continuous re-arm after an actionable child close.
Each adapter starts the next arm before delivering the wake prompt, checks current session-lock ownership at launch, preserves one child or scheduled retry at a time, and applies bounded exponential retry after an unexpected or failed close.
A failed follow-up never cancels continuity restoration.

## Actionable wake ordering

After an actionable Pi or OpenCode child close, the adapter starts and verifies one singleton successor before it delivers the original wake.
It waits at most one readiness timeout per attempt, then sends TERM and waits a bounded retirement confirmation before the next lock-verified exponential retry.
If the unready arm does not retire within that bound, the adapter keeps ownership, starts no overlapping retry, and delivers the typed fallback immediately.
When that retained arm later closes, its actual close is classified as a new supervised event without replaying the earlier fallback.
After the configured retry bound is exhausted, it delivers the original wake with a typed continuity-restoration failure even if every successor arm hung without reporting readiness.
This is deliberate Option B ordering: the fleet is protected before the model handles the wake whenever restoration succeeds, but the model is never left blind when it does not.

Claude retains its native tracked background-task completion path.
Its new PreToolUse continuity gate allows wake drain, arm recovery, and independently fail-closed teardown, but refuses other fleet commands while tasks are in flight and no identity-matched live watcher holds the home lock.
Allowing an ordinary literal teardown prevents a terminal wake from creating a recovery circle: forced or dynamically constructed teardown remains blocked, ordinary teardown itself still refuses dirty, unlanded, incomplete-scout, and unresolved-decision cases, and the turn-end guard continues to require supervision for any tasks left in flight.
Codex retains its bounded foreground checkpoint protocol.
Grok retains its tracked background-task notification protocol.
No adapter starts a replacement with shell `&`.

The existing turn-end guard implementation and adapters are unchanged.
They remain the final backstop rather than the normal continuity mechanism.

## Arm-layer cycle contract

`bin/fm-watch-arm.sh` never returns a clean empty success.
An actionable child output returns that reason normally.
A zero/empty child return rechecks the home lock and beacon, attaches to a verified healthy successor when one exists, or emits `watcher: FAILED - cycle ended without an actionable reason` and exits nonzero.
An attached arm follows verified identity-matched successors and reports the same typed failure if that chain ends without one.

## Single waiter per harness session

At most one arm blocks as the live waiter per home and harness, so a re-arm that finds a healthy watcher already backed by a live waiter never piles up a second blocked process.
The blocking arm records a waiter marker at `state/.watch-waiter` (serialized by `state/.watch-waiter.lock` under the shared lock conventions) naming itself by pid, its `fm_pid_identity` (so a recycled pid is a mismatch), and the detected harness.
A new `bin/fm-watch-arm.sh` arm (never `--restart`, which deliberately wants a fresh cycle) exits 0 at once with `already armed: waiter pid=<N> is the live wake source` only when a healthy watcher holds the lock AND that marker names a live identity-verified waiter for the same harness; it never blocks and never disturbs the older waiter.
Anchoring the fast exit on the watcher's own liveness, not the marker alone, keeps continuity safe: a watcher that just fired is no longer healthy, so the next re-arm becomes the new waiter instead of wrongly standing down.
If the recorded waiter is dead, or its identity or harness no longer matches, the new arm takes over as the waiter.
The waiter marker is cleaned up when its owning arm exits, and an abandoned `state/.watch-waiter.lock` owner directory is reaped on the next arm the same way the cycle-log lock is.
`opencode` and `pi` keep their adapter-owned single-flight through `--restart` and are unaffected; `claude` and `grok` re-arm through the plain arm, so they are the harnesses this fast exit protects.

The arm layer appends one tab-separated record per observed cycle to `state/.watch-cycle-exits.log`.
Each record includes arm and watcher PIDs, start and end timestamps, exit code and signal, classified reason, beacon age, lock identity before and after close, and successor disposition.
The file is size-capped through `FM_WATCH_CYCLE_LOG_MAX_BYTES` and `FM_WATCH_CYCLE_LOG_KEEP_LINES`.
`state/.watch-triage.log` remains only the watcher's bounded absorbed-wake debug log and carries no lifecycle semantics.

The default 300-second grace is unchanged.
Only the watcher process touches `state/.last-watcher-beat`; no helper process can make a wedged watcher appear healthy.

## Regression coverage

`tests/fm-pi-watch-extension.test.sh` simulates actionable and empty child closes against the actual Pi and OpenCode close handlers, blocks prompt delivery to prove the successor launches first, verifies single-flight behavior, changes the session lock before close to prove ownership is rechecked, and hangs each successor arm to prove bounded fallback delivery includes the typed restoration failure.
`tests/fm-watcher-lock.test.sh` covers verified-successor attach, the typed self-eviction failure, bounded and successor-linked lifecycle rows, and a SIGSTOP counterfactual that distinguishes a live PID from a stale beacon before classifying termination.
`tests/fm-continuity-pretool-check.test.sh` proves the Claude gate rejects only non-recovery fleet execution in the precise unhealthy state and preserves the existing Stop registration.

## Sanitized live evidence, 2026-07-17

All five harnesses ran against git-initialized scratch projects and isolated `FM_HOME` state.
Existing harness-managed credentials remained in place, no credential bytes were copied into a fixture or transcript, and no account was created.
Pi used the existing shared Pi auth store with the explicit `openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol` provider/model pin and low thinking.
Each run used the smallest prompt needed to exercise the harness-native path.

Harness versions:

```text
Claude Code 2.1.214
codex-cli 0.144.4
OpenCode 1.17.18
Pi 0.80.10
grok 0.2.103 (89c3d36fb6f1) [stable]
```

Claude ran an arm fixture through its native tracked background option, observed background completion, allowed the wake drain, and refused the next unrelated fleet command before its body executed.
The captured system message exactly named `[watcher-continuity]`, `bin/fm-wake-drain.sh`, tracked Claude re-arm through `bin/fm-watch-arm.sh`, and the blocked `fm-crew-state.sh` command.
Command: `FM_CLAUDE_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-claude-continuity-live-e2e.test.sh`.
Observed result: `ok - Claude 2.1.214 (Claude Code) live E2E refused only the post-completion fleet command with exact re-arm guidance`.

Codex ran the real one-second foreground watcher checkpoint and returned `checkpoint: no actionable wake within 1s` without switching to the arm wrapper.
Command: `FM_CODEX_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-codex-continuity-live-e2e.test.sh`.
Observed result: `ok - codex-cli 0.144.4 live E2E preserved the one-second foreground checkpoint path`.

OpenCode ran its persistent TUI plugin, established the first watcher from `session.idle`, received an actionable close, and ledger-linked a live successor before the model handled the wake.
The model executed no watcher-arm command and the turn-end backstop did not fire.
Command: `FM_OPENCODE_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-opencode-primary-live-e2e.test.sh`.
Observed result: `ok - OpenCode 1.17.18 live E2E auto-started one successor before prompt handling without a model re-arm`.

Pi loaded the tracked extensions in its interactive TUI, called `fm_watch_arm_pi` once, received an actionable close, and ledger-linked a successor before the handling turn ended.
The turn-end backstop did not fire, and `/quit` removed both the watcher and arm child.
Command: `FM_PI_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-pi-primary-live-e2e.test.sh`.
Observed result: `ok - Pi 0.80.10 live E2E used shared Codex auth, auto-started one successor before turn end, and cleaned up`.

Grok ran the real arm wrapper through `run_terminal_command` with its tracked background option, surfaced its native task-completion notification after the actionable close, and recorded `reason=actionable-signal` in the cycle ledger.
No shell ampersand was used.
Command: `FM_GROK_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-grok-continuity-live-e2e.test.sh`.
Observed result: `ok - grok 0.2.103 (89c3d36fb6f1) [stable] live E2E preserved tracked background completion and shared ledger classification`.

The goal is continuity with fewer supervision tokens and no Pi/OpenCode model-memory re-arm step.
No zero-latency guarantee is claimed; lock verification, watcher startup, and bounded retry delays remain deliberate safety work.
