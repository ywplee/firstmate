# tests/fm-secondmate-liveness.test.sh - the session-start secondmate LIVENESS
# guarantee: bin/fm-backend.sh's fm_backend_agent_alive probe (dispatching to
# fm_backend_tmux_agent_alive / fm_backend_herdr_agent_alive) and
# bin/fm-bootstrap.sh's secondmate_liveness_sweep() that acts on it.
#
# The gap under test (AGENTS.md "Session start"; evidence 2026-07-07): a
# secondmate agent that has exited leaves its backend endpoint alive as a bare
# shell. fm_backend_target_exists only checks pane PRESENCE, so it reports
# that shell "alive"; recovery only respawns endpoints reported dead, and the
# watcher deliberately exempts secondmates from stale-pane detection (an idle
# secondmate pane is healthy by design). A dead-shell secondmate was therefore
# invisible to every existing check and sat dead indefinitely.
#
# The guarantees under test:
#   - fm_backend_tmux_agent_alive classifies a verified-harness foreground
#     process as alive, a bare shell as dead, and anything ambiguous
#     (including a bare interpreter name) as unknown - never dead.
#   - fm_backend_herdr_agent_alive is a thin wrapper over the already-verified
#     fm_backend_herdr_pane_agent_state husk classifier: dead/no-agent -> dead,
#     live -> alive, unknown -> unknown.
#   - fm_backend_agent_alive routes to the right per-backend classifier and
#     reports unknown for a backend with no verified classifier (never errors).
#   - bin/fm-bootstrap.sh's secondmate_liveness_sweep is WORK-GATED (the
#     ephemeral-secondmate model): it respawns a confidently DEAD secondmate only
#     when its domain has work under way (an in-flight crewmate in the home, or a
#     routed request still awaiting a reply), killing the stale endpoint first
#     (the tmux adapter refuses to create a same-named window over a live one);
#     it keeps handled DEAD and ALIVE results silent, and never acts on an
#     inconclusive (UNKNOWN) reading.
#   - An idle secondmate with NO work is a healthy STOPPED state: the sweep leaves
#     it down and reports nothing (no probe, no respawn, no SECONDMATE_LIVENESS
#     line), whatever its endpoint reads.
#   - The sweep converges: once a secondmate reads alive, a later run never
#     re-touches it (idempotent by construction, not by remembering what it
#     already did).
#   - The sweep is skipped entirely under FM_BOOTSTRAP_DETECT_ONLY=1 (the
#     read-only session path), matching the other mutating sweeps.
#   - The sweep is naturally scoped to the primary: with no kind=secondmate
#     meta present (a secondmate's own state/ never holds one, since
#     secondmates never spawn secondmates), it is a silent no-op.
